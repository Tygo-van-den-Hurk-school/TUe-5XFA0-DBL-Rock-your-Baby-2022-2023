# TUe-DBL-Rock-Your-Baby
TU/e year 2, Quartile 2, course: Rock Your Baby

## What is this for?
This code is for the Rock your Baby course on TU/e, it contains two header files, and three source code files. The header files are for making an object, and for the source code we have to types of source code, two cpp files and one ino file. The cpp files together make the objects that we'll use in the ino file. These objects are working as drivers for the heartbeat sensor and the motor. The ino file is the main exicutible this will be used to run the algorithm.
